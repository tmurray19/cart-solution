Make receipts print items in the order they were added:
    - Currently uses a dict to store items
    - Dicts are not a FIFO structure
    - Use an OrderedDict instead

Add a total line to the receipt:
    - Calculate a total whenever the receipt is being generated

Be able to fetch product prices form an external source:
    - Create a way to open a JSON file and load external data sources
    - Loading JSON should be optional (optional 'alternative' price list, like a special sale)
    - Functionality for other dbs (mysql, mongodb, etc)?

Display price in different currencies:
    - Use something to convert existing price into desired price
    - Look at libraries

Update test suite to extend coverage and limit the number of tests which need changing when changes are introduced:
    - Expand to account for new functionality

Any other changes which improve the reliability of this code in production:
    - Ensure code can handle unexpected input
